Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.\n\n    ---\n\n    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"<tool_name>\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"param1\": \"<value1>\",\n            \"param2\": \"<value2>\"\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Please proceed with your task accordingly.\n\n    ",

We can start by considering the possible operations that can be performed with these numbers and see if they can lead to 24.\\n\\nFirst, let's try combining the numbers in different ways:\\n\\n1. Combine 2 and 8:\\n   - 2 + 8 = 10\\n   - 2 * 8 = 16\\n   - 8 - 2 = 6\\n   - 8 / 2 = 4\\n\\n2. Combine 8 and 14:\\n   - 8 + 14 = 22\\n   - 8 * 14 = 112\\n   - 14 - 8 = 6\\n   - 14 / 8 = 1.75\\n\\n3. Combine 2 and 14:\\n   - 2 + 14 = 16\\n   - 2 * 14 = 28\\n   - 14 - 2 = 12\\n   - 14 / 2 = 7\\n\\nNext, we need to see if any combination of these results can lead to 24. We should also consider using parentheses to change the order of operations if needed.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the possibilities:\\n- One potential approach is to use multiplication and addition, as these operations can increase the value quickly.\\n- Another approach is to use division and subtraction to adjust the values.\\n\\nWe need to find a combination that results in exactly 24. Let's try a few combinations:\\n\\n- (8 / 2) * (14 - 8) = 4 * 6 = 24\\n\\nThis equation uses all four numbers and results in 24. It appears to be a valid solution.\", 'evaluation': 0.9}",
