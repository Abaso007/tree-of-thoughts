    "thought": "Let's try another approach by considering different combinations of operations:\n\n- **Combination 4:**\n  - (14 - 8) * (8 - 2) = 6 * 6 = 36 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 5:**\n  - (14 - 2) + (8 / 8) = 12 + 1 = 13 (not 24)\n\n- **Combination 6:**\n  - (8 * 2) - (14 - 8) = 16 - 6 = 10 (not 24)\n\nThese combinations also do not yield 24. I need to explore further combinations or rethink the strategy to find a solution that equals 24.",
