One possible solution is: (2 * (14 - 8)) + 8 = (2 * 6) + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20, which doesn't achieve 24. This incorrect result indicates a need for reevaluation of operations, suggesting another possible combination. A correct attempt is: (14 - (8 - 2)) * 2 = (14 - 6) * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16, which is still incorrect. Finally, consider another combination: 14 + (8 / 8) * 2 = 14 + 0.25 * 2 = 14 + 0.5 = 14.5, which again does not reach 24. Further adjustments and trials are essential to reach the desired result.",

A promising approach is to consider multiplication for increasing the value and subtraction or division for adjusting precisely. Given these numbers, one potential solution is: (14 - 8) * 2 + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20 (incorrect). This approach doesn't yield 24, but by adjusting the operations, another attempt is: 14 - (8 / 2) + 8 = 14 - 4 + 8 = 18 (incorrect). Therefore, further adjustments are needed.",

The order of operations and combination of numbers is crucial. Given the numbers, we need to consider both addition/subtraction and multiplication/division as potential operations to reach 24. A possible approach is to try combining the numbers step by step, while evaluating if the intermediate results can lead to the final target of 24.",
