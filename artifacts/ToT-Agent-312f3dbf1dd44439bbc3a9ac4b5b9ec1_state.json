We can start by considering combinations that involve multiplication or division since these operations can quickly change the magnitude of numbers. One potential approach is to try and find two numbers whose product is close to 24, and then adjust the result using the other numbers.\n\nA simple and promising direction is to consider ending with a multiplication, as it can help to directly reach the target. For example, 2 * 8 = 16 is still far from 24, but since there are two 8s, we can consider using them in a more strategic way:\n\n1. Try to form numbers using subtraction and see if they can multiply to 24. For example, 14 - 8 = 6, then we can try making 24 using 6.\n2. Consider (8 - 2) = 6, then look at using 14 and 8 to make 4 to multiply with 6 resulting in 24.\n\nThis thought process involves trial and error in finding combinations, but thinking through these combinations logically should lead to a valid solution. It's crucial to evaluate these steps closely to ensure all numbers are used once and the operations result in exactly 24.",
