My initial approach is to consider combinations that utilize multiplication and addition primarily, as these are likely to generate larger numbers closer to 24.",

First, I will explore combinations of these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to see if I can achieve 24. One possible approach is to start by combining smaller numbers and gradually build up to 24. For example, I can try multiplying two numbers first and then see if I can adjust the result with addition or subtraction.",
