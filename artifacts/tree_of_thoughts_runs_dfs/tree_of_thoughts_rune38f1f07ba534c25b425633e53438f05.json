Now, I'll attempt to use these numbers with the operations +, -, *, and / to achieve 24.\n\nFirst, I'll try multiplying and adding these numbers:\n\n(8 * 3) = 24\n\nThis is already 24, so I can just multiply 8 by 3 to get the desired result. However, since I must use all four numbers, I need to incorporate 3 and 1 into the equation as well.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\n(8 * 3) - (3 / 1) = 24 - 3 = 21\n\nThis doesn't work, so I need to find a different combination.\n\nNow, I'll try:\n\n8 * (3 - (1 / 3)) = 8 * (3 - 0.3333) = 8 * 2.6667 \u2248 21.3336\n\nThis is close, but not exact.\n\nFinally, let's try:\n\n(8 / (3 - 1)) * 3 = (8 / 2) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12\n\nThis doesn't work either. I need to reevaluate my approach and try a different combination of operations and numbers.",
