            "thought": "To solve this problem, we need to use four numbers and basic arithmetic operations to reach the result of 24. The problem does not specify which four numbers to use, so I will assume we can choose any four numbers. A common set of numbers used in such problems is 1, 3, 4, and 6, as they can be combined in various ways to reach 24. Let's explore how we can use these numbers and operations to achieve the target.\n\nFirst, consider the equation: (6 * 4) - (3 * 1) = 24.\n\nThis equation uses multiplication and subtraction to reach the target number. Let's break it down:\n- Multiply 6 by 4 to get 24.\n- Multiply 3 by 1 to get 3.\n- Subtract 3 from 24 to get 21.\n\nThis equation does not reach 24, so let's adjust it. Instead, try: (6 / (1 - (3 / 4))) = 24.\n\nThis equation uses division and subtraction:\n- Divide 3 by 4 to get 0.75.\n- Subtract 0.75 from 1 to get 0.25.\n- Divide 6 by 0.25 to get 24.\n\nThis equation successfully reaches 24 using the numbers 1, 3, 4, and 6.",
