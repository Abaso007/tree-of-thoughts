The problem does not specify which four numbers to use, so I will assume that I can choose any four numbers. A common set of numbers used in such problems is 1, 3, 4, and 6, as they can be combined in various ways to reach 24.",

I will start by multiplying two numbers and then see how I can use the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\nLet's try: 6 * 4 = 24. This already gives us 24, but we need to use all four numbers. So, I will adjust the approach to ensure all numbers are used.\n\nOne possible equation is: (6 / (1 - (3/4))) = 24. This equation uses all four numbers and basic arithmetic operations to reach 24.",
