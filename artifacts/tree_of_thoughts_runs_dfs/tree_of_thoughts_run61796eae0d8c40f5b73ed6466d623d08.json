            "thought": "Let's start by identifying the numbers and operations at our disposal. The numbers given are 2, 8, 8, and 14. We can use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The goal is to manipulate these numbers using the operations to achieve a result of 24.\n\nFirst, we can try combining numbers to see what results are achievable and if they can be manipulated further to get to 24.\n\nOne approach would be to try multiplication first, as it can increase numbers quickly, which might be useful given that we have larger numbers like 14.\n\n1. Start with multiplication:\n   - 2 * 8 = 16. This gives us 16, with 8 and 14 left unused.\n   - 8 * 14 = 112. This seems too large, so let's not use this right away.\n\n2. Now, let's try using addition or subtraction:\n   - 8 + 14 = 22. This is close to 24, but not quite there.\n\n3. Consider combining operations:\n   - (2 * 8) + (14 - 8). We have 16 from 2 * 8, and 6 from 14 - 8, which gives 16 + 6 = 22. We're still not at 24, so let's try other combinations.\n\nThe challenge is to combine these numbers in a way that results in exactly 24. I'll continue exploring more combinations in the next thought process step.",
