Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.\n\n    ---\n\n    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"<tool_name>\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"param1\": \"<value1>\",\n            \"param2\": \"<value2>\"\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Please proceed with your task accordingly.\n\n    ",

Initially, a useful approach is to consider the multiplicative operations first, as they can quickly change the magnitude of numbers and potentially bring them closer to 24. For instance, using multiplication and addition together might yield faster results.\n\nOne possible strategy could involve:\n1. Multiplying some numbers to get a larger base number.\n2. Adding or subtracting the remaining numbers to adjust to exactly 24.\n\nLet's try this:\n- Multiply 2 and 8 to get 16.\n- Now we have 16, 8, and 14 remaining.\n- Add 8 to 16 to reach 24.\n- However, this still leaves the number 14 unused, which violates the condition of using all numbers.\n\nWe need to consider different combinations or possibly use division to adjust the values more precisely. Let's explore further:\n- Multiply 8 and 2 to get 16.\n- Try using division on 14 to bring its value down closer to a useful number.\n- For example, 14 divided by 2 gives 7.\n- Now our remaining numbers are 7, 8, and 16.\n- Add 8 and 16 to get 24, and we have used all numbers correctly.\n\nThis approach seems promising, but it still doesn't solve for using all four numbers in a single equation that results in 24. Let's refine further or test more combinations.",
