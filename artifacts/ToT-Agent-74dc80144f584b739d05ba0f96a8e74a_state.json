Your primary goal is to ensure the user receives well-structured JSON outputs that align with the tool's requirements.\n\n    ---\n\n    Here is the format you should always follow for your responses involving tool usage:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"<tool_name>\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"param1\": \"<value1>\",\n            \"param2\": \"<value2>\"\n        }\n    }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Please proceed with your task accordingly.\n\n    ",

Initially, I attempted the equations (14 - 8) * 2 + 8 and (14 - 2) + 8 / 8, both of which did not work. It's important to explore the use of division, particularly when identical numbers (8 and 8) are present, as dividing them by themselves yields 1, which could be useful in addition or subtraction. Another way to tackle this might be to use multiplication to reach a product close to 24 and adjust with addition or subtraction. I need to consider alternate orderings or nested operations (using parentheses) that might unlock a valid solution. A new perspective could be combining the larger number 14 in a subtractive or additive way that complements the result of operations involving 2 and the 8s.",
