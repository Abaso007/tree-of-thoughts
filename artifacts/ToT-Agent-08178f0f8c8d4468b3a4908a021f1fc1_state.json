A potential approach is to consider the operations that can produce 24 from these numbers. Since 24 is a product of 2 and 12, or 3 and 8, or 4 and 6, we can start by trying to form these intermediate results using the given numbers.\\n\\nLet's consider the possibility of using multiplication and addition:\\n1. Multiply 2 and 8 to get 16.\\n2. Subtract 8 from 14 to get 6.\\n3. Add the results of the two operations: 16 + 6 = 22.\\n\\nThis approach doesn't yield 24, so let's try another combination:\\n1.

Let's try another approach focusing on subtraction and multiplication:\\n1. Subtract 2 from 14 to get 12.\\n2. Multiply 12 by 2 to get 24.\\n3. This approach uses only two numbers, so let's try another method.\\n\\nWe need to ensure we use all four numbers in the equation, so let's try:\\n1. Multiply 8 by 3 to get 24 (since 3 is not directly available, consider using 8/2 to simulate a factor of 3).\\n2. Use 14 - 8 = 6 and then 6 * 4 = 24 (again, not directly achievable with the given numbers).\\n\\nThe challenge is to find a combination that uses all four numbers effectively. Let's try:\\n1. Divide 14 by 7 to get 2 (not possible directly, but consider 14 / 2 = 7).\\n2. Multiply 7 by 8 to get 56.\\n3. Divide 56 by 2 to get 28.\\n4. Subtract 4 (from 8/2) to get 24.\\n\\nThis approach is convoluted and not directly achievable with the given numbers. Let's focus on simpler arithmetic combinations:\\n1. Multiply 8 by 3 to get 24 (using 8/2 to simulate 3).\\n2. Use 14 - 8 = 6 and then 6 * 4 = 24 (again, not directly achievable with the given numbers).\\n\\nContinuing to explore these combinations, we need to find a straightforward solution that uses all four numbers. Let's try:\\n1. Use 14 - 8 = 6.\\n2. Use 8 - 2 = 6.\\n3.
