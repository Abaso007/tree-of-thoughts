# Tree-of-Thoughts Library Documentation

## Introduction

The Tree-of-Thoughts library is designed to provide a framework for representing and evaluating tree-like structures of thoughts, based on a model that assesses the quality of each node or 'thought' in the tree. The library is particularly helpful in applications that require a search over a vast space of potential solutions, like certain types of optimization problems, content generation, idea exploration, or decision-making processes.

## Overview of ASearch Class

### Purpose

The `ASearch` class serves as an implementation of a search algorithm, aiming to navigate through a thought tree to find the most valuable 'thought', as evaluated by a provided model. The class utilizes techniques such as A* search optimization, pruning, and goal evaluation to efficiently identify the best solution path within a complex space of possibilities.

### Architecture

The class inherits from `TreeofThoughts`, using attributes to represent the current best state (`best_state`), its associated value (`best_value`), and the history (`history`) of all states evaluated during the search. The `tree` attribute holds the structure containing the thoughts.

### How it Works

The `solve` method initializes the thought tree with an `initial_prompt` node and iteratively expands potential thoughts using the `generate_thoughts` method from the model. It utilizes a priority queue to maintain a frontier of promising thoughts, and applies pruning and scoring to guide the search toward promising paths while avoiding less valuable ones. The goal is determined by the `is_goal` method, which checks if the current state score satisfies a goal condition. Once a goal state is reached, `reconstruct_path` backtracks to form the optimal path from the initial state to the goal state.

## Methods

### solve

The `solve` method conducts the search, starting from an `initial_prompt` and continuing for a given number of steps or until a solution is found.

#### Parameters

| Parameter          | Type  | Description                                   | Default |
|--------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| initial_prompt     | str   | The initial state from which to start the search. |         |
| num_thoughts       | int   | Number of thoughts to generate at each step.  | 5       |
| max_steps          | int   | Maximum number of steps to take in the search.| 30      |
| pruning_threshold  | float | Threshold below which thoughts will be pruned.| 0.4     |

#### Returns

A list representing the solution path from the initial prompt to the goal state, or the last state reached if no goal state was found.

#### Usage Example

```python
from treeofthoughts import ASearch

# Initialize the ASearch with an evaluation model
search = ASearch(evaluation_model)

# Perform the search
solution_path = search.solve(initial_prompt='Start here')

# Output the solution path
print("Solution Path: ", solution_path)
```

### is_goal

Determines if a given state is a goal state based on its score.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type  | Description                               |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| state     | str   | The state to be evaluated as a goal state.|
| score     | float | The evaluation score of the state.        |

#### Returns

Boolean indicating whether the state is a goal state.

#### Usage Example

```python
# Assuming is_goal is a public method for the purpose of demonstration
is_goal_reached = search.is_goal(state='Some state', score=0.95)

# Output the result
print("Is goal state: ", is_goal_reached)
```

### reconstruct_path

Reconstructs the solution path from a current state back to the initial prompt.

#### Parameters

| Parameter       | Type | Description                                |
|-----------------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| came_from       | dict | A mapping from each state to its predecessor. |
| current_state   | str  | The current state to trace back from.      |
| initial_prompt  | str  | The initial state to trace back to.        |

#### Returns

A list representing the path from the initial state to the current state.

#### Usage Example

```python
# Example usage within the search.solve method when a goal is found
path = self.reconstruct_path(came_from, goal_state, initial_prompt)
print("Reconstructed Path: ", path)
```
