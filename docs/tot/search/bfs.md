## BFS (Breadth-First Search)

### Overview and Introduction

The `BFS` class is part of the *Tree-of-Thoughts* library, which is designed to facilitate the generation and evaluation of conceptual models based on an initial prompt using the Breadth-First Search algorithm. The library's purpose is to explore the potential of generating a wide range of ideas (thoughts) and identifying the most valuable ones through the systematized process of state evaluation and pruning.

Key concepts within this library include:
- **Thought Generation**: Producing new ideas based on an existing state.
- **State Evaluation**: Assigning a value to a given state based on defined criteria.
- **Pruning**: Eliminating less promising states based on a dynamic threshold to maintain manageable search space.

### Class Definition

```python
class BFS(TreeofThoughts):
    ...
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter           | Type    | Default   | Description                                         |
|---------------------|---------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `initial_prompt`    | str     | N/A       | The initial prompt for generating thoughts.         |
| `num_thoughts`      | int     | N/A       | Number of thoughts to generate at each state.       |
| `max_steps`         | int     | N/A       | Maximum number of steps to take in the search.      |
| `max_states`        | int     | N/A       | Maximum number of states to track.                  |
| `value_threshold`   | float   | N/A       | Value threshold for state selection.                |
| `pruning_threshold` | float   | 0.5       | Threshold for dynamic pruning.                      |

### Usage and Functionality

The `BFS` class provides the `solve` method for executing the Breadth-First Search algorithm. The method generates thoughts at each step, evaluates those thoughts, and prunes the less promising states based on a dynamically adjusted threshold.

Example usage:

```python
from tree_of_thoughts import BFS  # Hypothetical import statement

# Initialize BFS with hypothetical parameters
bfs_solver = BFS()
solution = bfs_solver.solve(
    initial_prompt="Tell me about the future of technology.",
    num_thoughts=10,
    max_steps=100,
    max_states=50,
    value_threshold=0.7
)
if solution:
    print("Solution found:", solution)
else:
    print("No solution could be found.")
```

### Additional Information and Tips

When using the `BFS` class, make sure to fine-tune the parameters for your specific use case. Adjust `num_thoughts`, `max_steps`, and `max_states` carefully to balance the breadth of exploration against available computational resources.

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Simple Idea Generation

```python
# Simple example of using BFS for idea generation
initial_prompt = "How can we improve public transportation?"
bfs_solver = BFS()
ideas = bfs_solver.solve(initial_prompt, 5, 20, 10, 0.5)
...
```

#### Example 2: Deep Exploration

```python
# Deep exploration with a higher number of steps and states
initial_prompt = "Exploring the frontiers of space travel."
bfs_solver = BFS()
in_depth_ideas = bfs_solver.solve(initial_prompt, 10, 100, 100, 0.6)
...
```

#### Example 3: Pruning Sensitivity

```python
# Adjusting the pruning threshold for more aggressive pruning
initial_prompt = "What are the future trends in education?"
bfs_solver = BFS()
targeted_ideas = bfs_solver.solve(initial_prompt, 5, 50, 20, 0.8, pruning_threshold=0.75)
...
```
