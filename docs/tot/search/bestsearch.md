If you decide to create full-fledged documentation, here are some pointers on how to proceed with in-depth examples using the given outline:

* Provide **detailed descriptions** for all methods and attributes, explaining not only the "what" but the "why"; dig into the reasoning behind the design decisions.
* For each **function/method**, provide at least three code examples covering different use cases and complexities:
    * A basic example that shows the most simple and straightforward use of the function.
    * An intermediate example that perhaps integrates the function with other elements of the library or external code.
    * An advanced example that shows how to use the function in complex, real-world situations or how to handle errors and exceptions properly.
* Offer a narrative around the examples; don't just show the code but also **explain the thought process** behind the code, why certain choices were made, and what each part of the code is expected to do.
* Discuss potential issues users might face and provide proven solutions or workarounds.
* Be sure to explain any prerequisites or assumptions made before proceeding with the examples.
* Make use of **tables in markdown** to display parameters, data types, returns, and possible values in a structured and visually appealing manner. Here is a markdown table example for the `__init__` method of the `BESTSearch` class:

```markdown
| Parameter | Type  | Description                                 | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| model     | Model | The model used for generating thoughts.     | None    |
```

* Discuss the architecture and explain how the class `BESTSearch` integrates with the broader TreeOfThoughts library. Explore the rationale behind using a tree structure for storing thoughts and how this enables certain kinds of problem-solving or decision-making processes.
* Use diagrams where appropriate to illustrate how data flows through the system or how components interact with one another.

Remember that documentation is as much about transferring knowledge as it is about being a reference. Take the user on a journey from not knowing to understanding and, finally, to effectively using the TreeOfThoughts library.
